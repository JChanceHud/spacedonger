check: actor needs setFile before addAnimation, try to make it possible to just call addAnimation
check if scaling for box2d objects possible
allow gamvas.Vector2D for gamvas.Camera.toWorld() and toScreen() as alternative to x,y
maybe parallax scrolling sysem as in sge2d: define layers, add actors to layers, define one layer as main layer for camera calculation
test if window.requestAnimationFrame uses double buffering, if not, introduce doublebuffering
disable/enable particle emitter
on input events, check if receiving actor still exists, if not, remove from list of input event actors
- same with state actors
- same with physic engine
check if resetWorld() destroys all objects, if not, destroy manually
physics: get object under mouse
- add onMouseOver and onMouseOut events

nice to have:

check distance between physical objects while including its physics shape into the calculation (aka how many pixels until contact)
